File “run_analysis.R” creates final tidy dataset called “final_tidy.txt”

The file has 81 columns:
First column is -
SUBJECT  :  subject number

Second column is - 
ACTIVITY_CLASS : type of activity that subject was performing when measurements were taken.

ACTIVITY_CLASS can be one of the following six value:
i. LAYING
ii. SITTING
iii. STANDING
iv. WALKING
v. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
vi. WALKIJNG_UPSTAIRS

Rest of 79 columns contain values that are "averages" of variables summarised by each activity and subject. The names of the columns are same as the variables names for which the averages have been taken.

Notes: 
======
- for each variable, the names that have "mean" as a part of the name, are mean value features
- for each variable, the names that have "std" as a part of the name, are standard deviation value features
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The 79 column names are as follows:
